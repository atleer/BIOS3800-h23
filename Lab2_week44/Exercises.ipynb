    "In the wet lab this week you will study spikes, representing action potentials, in cockroach legs. Different types of sensory neurons respond to different stimuli, including pain, pressure, stretch, or chemicals. Cockroaches use their antennae and cerci to receive information from their environment. Each cercus is covered with a large number of long, sensitive, tactile hairs or \"sensilla\", which are a lot finer than the spines on the cockroachâ€™s legs. A microscopic view of the hairs shows many specializations in size, shape, and spatial distribution, which allow these hairs to be stimulated by a variety of stimuli, including vibrations, air movements, and low frequency sound waves. The cockroach leg is studded with stiff hairs and spines. At the base of each spine is a single sensory neuron. The cell body of the neuron lies just under the cuticle of the spine, with the unbranched dendrite of the neuron projecting up through the overlying cuticle. In the wet lab we will apply pressure to individual spines using toothpicks to stimulate spiking. Here's an illustration of the experimental setup and a cockroach spine:\n",

    "Observe in the plot above that some peaks are broader than the others (the peaks at around 30 and 50 ms f. ex.). That's because it's actually two spikes that are so close that they are plotted as one peak. Of course, it can happen that a neuron fires at a very high frequency, but in these cases the inter-spike interval is 1 ms, which is so small that in all likelihood one of the spikes comes from a different neuron in the vicinity of the recording electrode, and that spike has been mistakenly assigned to this neuron. This kind of pollution of the recorded signal can happen in your experiments too. It might show up as an increased amplitude of the action potential relative to other, non-polluted action potentials. In the plot below we have illustrated this for the neuron and trial selected from this dataset.\n",

If $CV^2 = 1$, then the neuron is in a Poisson firing mode - there is no relationship between the intervals between spikes, the neuron fires at random. If $CV^2 > 1$, then the neuron is in bursting mode - there is a lot of variability in the firing intervals because in some periods the neuron fires a lot, so the intervals are very short, then it will (usually) begin to adapt and fire less and less, which means that the inter-spike intervals increase."
